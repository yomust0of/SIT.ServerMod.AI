hey this is probably the most autistic way i can choose to reach you,
but i wanted to ask you about some things with your old SIT system for offline tarkov,
im trying to get this running for me and my buddies,
i still have a copy of 12.12.31.19~~~ and want to know if i could get some assistance setting it up initially,
and if i can get it going anywhere, i want to try to add to it,
or atleast make it work for future versions of the game, yomust0of#4673 if you use discord.
